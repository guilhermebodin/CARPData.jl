This package reads `.dat` data files in a custom format for Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) instances and returns `Data` type:

```julia
struct Data
    name      ::String         # Instance name
    
    capacity  ::Int64          # Vehicles' capacity
    vehicles  ::Int64          # Number of vehicles
    
    vertices  ::Vector{Vertex} # List with all vertices
    edges     ::Vector{Edge}   # List with all edges (required or not)
    requireds ::Vector{Edge}   # List with required edges
    
    lb        ::Int64          # Known lower bound
    ub        ::Int64          # Known upper bound
end
```

where `Vertex` type:

```julia
struct Vertex
    id        ::Int64          # Sequential id, starting with 1
    
    edges     ::Vector{Edge}   # List with all incident edges (required or not)
    requireds ::Vector{Edge}   # List with required incident edges
end
```

and where `Edge` type:

```julia
struct Edge
    id        ::Int64          # Sequential id, starting with 1

    from      ::Vertex         # First vertex
    to        ::Vertex         # Second vertex
    
    cost      ::Int64          # Edge cost
    demand    ::Int64          # Edge demand (zero for depot)
end
```

Graph is undirected and depot is always vertex 1.

To install:
```julia
] add https://github.com/rafaelmartinelli/CARPData.jl

See the [full list](https://github.com/rafaelmartinelli/CARPData.jl/tree/main/data).
There are some other instances (`A` and `B`), but I could not find their origin (if you know, please send me a message).

For example, to load `kshs1.dat`:
```julia
data = load(:kshs1)
```

For instances with `-`, use `_` instead:
```julia
data = load(:egl_e2_A)
```
Julia symbols do not allow `-`.

For custom CARP files, you must use the custom instance format. Check the `README` in the data directory for instructions.
```julia
data = load("path/to/my/instance.ext")
```
