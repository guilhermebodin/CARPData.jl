# CARPData.jl

This package reads `.dat` data files in a custom format for Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) instances and returns `Data` type:

```julia
struct Data
    name      ::String         # Instance name
    
    capacity  ::Int64          # Vehicles' capacity
    vehicles  ::Int64          # Number of vehicles
    
    vertices  ::Vector{Vertex} # List with all vertices
    edges     ::Vector{Edge}   # List with all edges (required or not)
    requireds ::Vector{Edge}   # List with required edges
    
    lb        ::Int64          # Known lower bound
    ub        ::Int64          # Known upper bound
end
```

where `Vertex` type:

```julia
struct Vertex
    id        ::Int64          # Sequential id, starting with 1
    
    edges     ::Vector{Edge}   # List with all incident edges (required or not)
    requireds ::Vector{Edge}   # List with required incident edges
end
```

and where `Edge` type:

```julia
struct Edge
    id        ::Int64          # Sequential id, starting with 1

    from      ::Vertex         # First vertex
    to        ::Vertex         # Second vertex
    
    cost      ::Int64          # Edge cost
    demand    ::Int64          # Edge demand (zero for depot)
end
```

Graph is undirected and depot is always vertex 1.

See the [full list](https://github.com/rafaelmartinelli/CARPData.jl/tree/main/data).
There are some other instances (groups A and B), but I could not find their origin (if you know, please send me a message).

For example, to load `kshs1.dat`, you can do:
```julia
tsp = load(:kshs1)
```

Known issues:
- Instances with '-' do not load. For example: egl-s1-A.dat.

For custom CARP files, you must use my custom instance format. Check `readme.txt` in the data directory for instructions.
